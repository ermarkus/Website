    <div class="text-block">I revisited theme of parties in this piece, "Friday Night." This time, I chose to convey the atmosphere of a party by means of a double image: where one can unfocus their eye and look at the colorful lights spread across the page, or focus their eye and read whats written on the page.</div>

    <div class="text-block">The questions were chosen to provoke a sincere response, and in turn gather real data about the 20-year-olds attending this party. Some responses included “Parties are social, parties are political,” “F*** this,” “Why not?” “None of your business!” and “I don’t know.”</div>

    <div class="text-block">After the data was collected, I took photos of each poster in the disco lights, and put them into a fold-out booklet that expands into a full-size poster reading, "Why?"</div>
